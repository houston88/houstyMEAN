#Bootstrap AngularJS Fullstack Node Simple Start
=============

Used the Yeoman AngularJS + Express Full Stack Generator that provides:

 * Express server integrated with grunt tasks
 * Livereload of client and server files
 * Support for Jade and CoffeeScript
 * Easy deployment workflow.
 * Optional MongoDB integration
 * Optional Passport integration for adding user accounts

After that I modified to create a base project for:

 * MEAN stack starter project, customized for family launch page.
 * Based on the bootstrap 3.0 carousel example.
 * Commented out sample api that connects to mongo.

To run, refer to the AngularJs Full Stack generator docs:
